A programming-themed word guessing game inspired by Wordle. Save your favorite languages from the clutches of Assembly by guessing the secret word before it's too late!

## Demo

## Description

In **Assembly Endgame**, you have up to 8 wrong guesses to figure out the hidden programming-related word (3-6 letters). Each incorrect guess "eliminates" a programming language from the ecosystem, overlaying it with a skull emoji and a dark fade effect. If you run out of guesses, Assembly takes over the world! Win by revealing the full word, or lose and face the low-level reality.

The game features dynamic visual feedback, farewell messages for fallen languages, and a mix of humor and tension for developers.

## How to Play

1. **Guess Letters**: Click keyboard buttons to guess letters in the hidden word.
2. **Feedback**:
   - Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
   - Wrong guesses eliminate a language (with a skull overlay) and show a farewell message.
3. **Win Condition**: Reveal the entire word before 8 wrong guesses.
4. **Lose Condition**: 8 wrong guesses, and Assembly wins ‚Äì revealing missed letters in red.
5. **New Game**: Reset with a random word after winning or losing.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React (with hooks like `useState` for managing game state).
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with a modern reset (box-sizing, font-smoothing, etc.), Flexbox for layout, transitions for animations, and pseudo-elements for overlays (e.g., skull on lost languages).
- **Utilities**:
  - `clsx`: For conditional class names (e.g., correct/wrong/disabled buttons).
  - Custom utils: `getFarewellText` for dynamic messages, `getRandomWords` for word selection.
- **Data**: `languages` array with color-coded styles for each language.
- **Build/Deployment**: Assumes Vite or Create React App; deployable to Vercel/Netlify.

No backend required ‚Äì fully client-side!
